# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Planner Buckets.

## Development setup

1. Install Node.js 20.19 or newer within the Node 20 line, Node.js 22.12 or newer within the Node 22 line, or Node.js 24.x.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Branch and PR workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep commits focused and small.
3. Run checks before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run verify
```

4. Open a PR with:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- How to test it
- Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes

## Coding guidelines

- Use TypeScript types for new data/state shapes.
- Prefer small reducer actions with explicit state transitions.
- Keep animation/motion timings on shared CSS tokens when possible.
- Avoid changing unrelated behavior in the same PR.

## Testing guidelines

- Add or update reducer tests for logic changes in `src/state/plannerReducerV2.ts`.
- For v1 compatibility, migration, or import/export changes, include coverage near the relevant import, persistence, or migration tests.
- For UI behavior changes, include manual test steps in the PR. Cover affected drag/drop, clipboard, sidepanel, import/export, and responsive states when relevant.

## Security and privacy

- Do not commit secrets or tokens.
- Do not commit local export files (`bsp-planner-*.json`).
- Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities.
